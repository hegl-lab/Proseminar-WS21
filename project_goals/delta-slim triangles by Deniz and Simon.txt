delta-slim triangles in hyperbolic models- a Project by Deniz Aydin and Simon Heidrich

In this project we want to explore the delta-hyperbolicity of triangles in hyperbolic triangles. It is set up in multiple steps, as soon as we achive one goal we proceed with the next one.

1. For given triangle on the Poincaré-disk model find the minimal delta
	Output: Jupiter-Notebook
	1.1 show given triangle with a given delta-neigbourhood in The Poincaré-disk model in a svg or png
	1.2 algorithm and/or mathematical formula to determine the minimal delta for the triangle
	1.3 show the results (triangle with delta-neigbourhood and delta-value) as svg or png
2.The delta for the Poincaré-disk model
	Output: Jupiter-Notebook
	2.1 create random triangles in Poincaré-disk model
	2.2 find algorithm to determine the delta numerically (and show mathematican way to find delta)
	2.3 show results and 'proof' that the delta hold by user input triangle
3.What do transforms with the delta-slim property?
	Output: still to be determined
	3.1 visualize transformations into other models of triangle with it's delta neigbourhood
	3.2 the things we find out in the process...
