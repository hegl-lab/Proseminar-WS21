Ping Pong Game in Hyperboic geometry

General plan:
Making a ping pong game on the Poincaré disk. Two players playing against each other.
The goal is to visualise certain aspects of the Poincaré disk in an entertaining way.

Goals until 1st December:
Understanding how to make hyperbolic graphics and objects move. Finishing the general concept of our game and what it's supposed to look like.
